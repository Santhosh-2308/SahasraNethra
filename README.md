# SahasraNethra

## Overview  
"SahasraNethra" is an AI-powered disaster prediction and early warning system that utilizes advanced remote sensing technologies to detect and forecast natural disasters. By analyzing satellite imagery, sensor data, and geophysical parameters, the system aims to provide early warnings for hazards such as:  

- Volcanic eruptions  
- Glacier melting  
- Wildfires  
- Tsunamis  
- Tectonic earthquakes  

Currently, **SahasraNethra is in the prototype stage and is still under development**. The project is focused on demonstrating the potential of AI-driven disaster prediction through simulations and visualizations. Future versions will incorporate real-time data processing and automated alert systems.  

## Tech Stack  
SahasraNethra is built using:  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Data Processing**: AI-based disaster prediction (prototype stage)  
- **Visualization**: Web-based interface for viewing disaster alerts  

## How It Works  
1. **Simulated Data Representation**: Demonstrates disaster scenarios using sample satellite imagery and geophysical data.  
2. **Prototype AI Analysis**: Conceptual implementation of AI-based disaster prediction.  
3. **Mock Alert System**:  
   - Displays simulated alerts on the interface.  
   - Showcases how alerts could be sent via SMS, calls, WhatsApp, and other channels in a full implementation.  
4. **User Interaction**: Provides a web-based platform for viewing disaster risk information.  

## Features  
- Conceptual AI-driven disaster prediction  
- Interactive web-based visualization  
- Simulated multi-channel alert system  
- Prototype demonstration of emergency response coordination  
- **Under development** for real-time data integration and automated alerts  

## Development Roadmap  
SahasraNethra is still in **active development**, with planned improvements including:  
- **Integration of real-time satellite and sensor data**  
- **Training AI models for more accurate disaster prediction**  
- **Building backend infrastructure for live alerts and notifications**  
- **Enhancing the UI for better data visualization**  
- **Testing with real-world disaster datasets**
